# Simple canvas game

The following is based on the short instructional guide of **Matt Hackett's**, 
**[How to make a simple HTML5 Canvas game](https://www.genome.gov/)**.

The aim of this project is to familiarize myself with game related concepts and functions while at the same time putting my own spin on it.
